DONT use es6 modules

when writing css dont use @apply group, doeesnt work with tailwind
Tailwind v3 has strict rules for @apply.
You can only apply “plain utilities” (like bg-gray-200, flex, p-4, etc.).
You cannot @apply the following kinds of classes:

State variants: hover:, focus:, active:, disabled:, visited:, checked:, etc.

Peer / group modifiers: peer, peer-checked:, group-hover:, group-focus:, etc.

Pseudo-elements: before:, after:, placeholder:, file:, etc.

Arbitrary variants like [&>div]:…

Screen prefixes (sm:, md:, lg: …) sometimes work, but only if applied on utilities directly, not standalone like sm:.
